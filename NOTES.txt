To create a constant in Python that you can use in multiple places, add it to the top of your code.
The naming convention for constants is ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE.

In the past, I've checked whether a number is within a range of values like this:
if number > 1 and number <= 6
But there's a much simpler way: if 1 < number <= 6

Remember, a dictionary's values() method lets you get each key/value pair.

To copy a list, you can write 'list_copy = list_name[:]'
In this case, the colon is called the "slice operator".
This prevents two variables from pointing by reference to the same object (i.e. changing one changes the other).

An array's remove() method removes the first instance of a given value.

In a print() statement, the 'end' attribute specifies what to end a line with (default is a new line '\n').
This is useful when you want to print elements of an array on the same line instead of separate lines.
